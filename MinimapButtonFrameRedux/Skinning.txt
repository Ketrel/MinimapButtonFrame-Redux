To Add a skin to the list in MBF use the function

MBFAddSkin( "NAME", "BorderPath" , "BackdropPath", size)

The size value really should always be 35 but I've left it as an option just in case.

The easiest way is to create a small addon that with the lua file containing only



if not IsAddOnLoaded("MinimapButtonFrame") then
	return
end

MBFAddSkin( "NAME", "BorderPath" , "BackdropPath", size)





You would still have to create a .TOC file as per a normal addon and make sure that your textures were included.
